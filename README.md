This project explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, visual storytelling, and urban identity, using CycleGANs and Neural Style Transfer to reimagine the cities of Klagenfurt and Udine through the lenses of Rembrandt, Bellotto, and Canaletto.

Structured in two phases:

🖼️ Phase 1 – Artistic Identity Remix
Translates modern urban photographs into artworks inspired by classical painters.

Uses:

✅ CycleGAN for unpaired style translation

✅ Neural Style Transfer with VGG19

Examines how artistic heritage can be re-applied to contemporary cityscapes.

🏛️ Phase 2 – Urban Reverie
Imagines cross-city transformations between Udine and Klagenfurt.

AI models simulate how one city's identity would appear through the architectural soul of the other.
